You might want to use a newish version of ROOT, like 5.2X+ 
I think you might see weird error messages when running on the default ROOT in some D0 releases. 

This sets of macros are designed to take several root files (all with the same collection of TH1s or TTree in them) 
and plot all the TH1s/branches one by one, doing line overlays, or data-bkg comparisons, or data vs sumbkg ratios.  
It is all setup in the config file: compare_files.list
You should set there: - the type of comparison you want: Histo.Type: Legend, StatBox, Add, Ratio
                      - a total normalization if you want to compare shapes
                      - to read all TH1s/branches in the file or only those matching: PlotOnlyHistosWithName: JetPull
                      - the number of files to compare
                      - the location of those files, the color and name (for the legend) of each sample, 
                        and if there is a directory structure for the TH1s. You can also add a scale factor to each source. 

Be careful with the PlotOnlyHistosWithName option. If you leave it empty, it won't plot anything! 
So you should put something like "h_" or "lep"  to plot all histos starting with h_ or lep for example. 
If you really want to plot all and they don't have commnon names, then you can comment out the if with match_only_histo in compare_histos.C.

A usual way to run the script is:
 ./compare_histos.sh -goodnbins=20 -force -outdir=myplots -config=compare_files.list

You can get more info on the options if you run:
./compare_histos.sh

The output will be a directory (-outdir=myplots) with the gif and eps files and a index.html file to display all resulting plots.
